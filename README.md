This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease in patients using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing health-related features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and others, the model aims to assist in early diagnosis and risk prediction.

📌 Project Overview

Goal: Build a machine learning model to predict heart disease presence.
Algorithms Used:
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
XGBoost
Dataset: UCI Heart Disease dataset (or equivalent)
Tools & Libraries:
